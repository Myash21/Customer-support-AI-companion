      "body": "Hi team, we're trying to set up our primary Snowflake production database as a new source in Atlan, but the connection keeps failing. We've tried using our standard service account, but it's not working. Our entire BI team is blocked on this integration for a major upcoming project, so it's quite urgent. Could you please provide a definitive list of the exact permissions and credentials needed on the Snowflake side to get this working? Thanks."

      "body": "Hello, I'm new to Atlan and trying to understand the lineage capabilities. The documentation mentions automatic lineage, but it's not clear which of our connectors (we use Fivetran, dbt, and Tableau) support this out-of-the-box. We need to present a clear picture of our data flow to leadership next week. Can you explain how lineage capture differs for these tools?"

Is there a tutorial or a quick guide you can point me to?"

To do this, we need to programmatically extract lineage data from Atlan via an API. Does the API expose lineage information, and if so, could you provide an example of the endpoint and the structure of the response?"

      "body": "This is infuriating. We have a critical Snowflake view, `finance.daily_revenue`, that is built from three upstream tables. Atlan is correctly showing the downstream dependencies, but the upstream lineage is completely missing. This makes the view untrustworthy for our analysts. We've re-run the crawler multiple times. What could be causing this? This is a huge problem for us."

Manually creating each one and linking them to thousands of assets seems impossible. Is there a bulk import feature using CSV or an API to create terms and link them to assets? This is blocking our entire governance initiative."

However, when I search for this table in the Atlan UI, it doesn't appear. It seems like it's getting stuck somewhere between extraction and publishing. Can you please investigate the root cause?"

Should we use separate workspaces, or can we achieve isolation using teams and permissions within a single workspace while maintaining a consistent governance model?"
