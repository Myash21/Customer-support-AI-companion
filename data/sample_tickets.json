      "body": "Hi team, we're trying to set up our primary Snowflake production database as a new source in Atlan, but the connection keeps failing. We've tried using our standard service account, but it's not working. Our entire BI team is blocked on this integration for a major upcoming project, so it's quite urgent. Could you please provide a definitive list of the exact permissions and credentials needed on the Snowflake side to get this working? Thanks."

However, when I search for this table in the Atlan UI, it doesn't appear. It seems like it's getting stuck somewhere between extraction and publishing. Can you please investigate the root cause?"

As we roll this out to more teams, what are some common best practices or features within Atlan that can help us maintain good catalog hygiene and prevent this problem from getting worse?"

We're looking for advice on the best way to structure our Atlan instance. Should we use separate workspaces, or can we achieve isolation using teams and permissions within a single workspace while maintaining a consistent governance model?"
